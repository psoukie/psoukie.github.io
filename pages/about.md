Hello! I’m Pavel – a father, husband, and business professional. At my core, I am driven by a passion for understanding and connecting the world through technology, culture, and language.

My interests span from the nuances of different cultures and languages to the ever-evolving world of AI and technology. I'm also an avid fan of design, music, board games, and life philosophy. I have two sons, and I live with my wife on Whidbey Island in Washington state.

My work has focused on building award-winning global enterprise solutions for the world’s top technology companies. In my spare time, I teach at the University of Washington, sharing what I’ve learned with others.

This website is a reflection of my interests. It’s a space where I share insights, experiences, and the occasional musings on the things that pique my curiosity.

Welcome, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you.
