# Orion Hellcat
Individuals and local impact
People often say, “photographs don’t do it justice.” This is definitely true of the Hellcat’s goreous burgundy dial. As it catches rays of light, it changes from deep, almost chocolate color to intriguing fiery red highlights.
Even though this watch is from a micro brand, without a long history to boast about, this watch came extremely close to me not being able to find a single thing about it that — in my eyes — could be improved. That is how well this piece accomplishes what it aims for.[^improve]

[^improve]: It was only when I read another person’s review when I realized the color of the lettering of the dates in the date window is black, which does not really match anything else on the watch. Of course, black goes with everything, but one can dream of the numbers being printed in an oxblood ink.
This is a reminder of how difficult it is to integrate a date function on a watch in an aesthetically pleasing way. The shape and size of the window (btw, beautifully realized on my old Christopher Ward C3 Malvern), the colors of the wheel and lettering, the typeface used, the position of the window — all these are difficult to get ideally in harmony with the rest of the watch, and it is why purists generally prefer watches without a date. It is easy to overlook on the Hellcat, which would otherwise be perfect, had the lettering matched the watch.

The watch is full of intricate details — the cross hairs are fairly clear, but then you notice the minute track, with alternating TK-minute segments with small dots in inverse; the knurled winding wheel (TK what is the right term?), and the solid case back (which is authentic for this type of watch) which features a barely noticeable curvature for added comfort.
