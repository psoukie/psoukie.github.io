Appreciation of watches is in part about nostalgia. Otherwise, you might as well rely on your smartphone. I love older technology, such as typewriters, so it is no wonder that I like mechanical watches. But there is a lot to be admired, even when the the thing beating at the heart of the watch is a quartz crystal, as demonstrated by for example Citizen movements with +/- 1 second accuracy per year. 

Why wear a watch? To tell the time, obviously. Which can be done very well with a phone too. But you need to take out the phone, instead of glancing at your wrisst. It’s obviously also a fashions choice. And as a dedicated tool, a watch doe it’s job much better than a phone.
A watch will work well during a trans-oceanic trip without any risk of running out of power. And it can be small enough that you can forget about it.

How to build a watch collection without becoming a collector

 

Field watches

The main consideration is sturdiness.

Also referred to as beater watch. 

Base the price point around the expectation that this watch willl break or will be lost or damaged. (Actually, this principle should apply to all the watches in your collection.)

 

Like anything we wear or use, watches are Dubuque to to wear and tear. The difference is that the field watch is built to withstand much better some of the harsher moments, and where the likelihood of major mishaps is greater.

 

But bear in mind that even the nicer and more expensive watches — even the most prized watch of you collection — should be chosen so that you can endure its inadvertent damage or loss.

 

The key word for a field watch is utility. It’s a watch that is always ready, easy to read, and can withstand some sweat, shocks and water. (Anecdote about water when not expected while fixing a pump.) Because of these considerations, a metal bracelet (or a rubber band) is likely a better choice than leather. Because of practicality, for a field watch, I also prefer a solar-powered watch, and definitely a quartz movement over mechanical. This is about utility, and not nostalgia.

 

The watch should have at least 10 ATM water resistance. (Copy the anecdote mentioned above.), and depending on your needs, more than that. For the absolute best in shock resistance, you can also go with watch with an LCD display.

 

My choice was Citizen Promaster Tough, but there are MANY other great options. One of the most respectable ones are under the Casio G-Shock line. About $50 gets you a historically significant watch that’s likely to survive everything you can, and more.

 

The next watch that should be the dress watch. …. Everyone should have a utility watch, and the same goes for a dress watch. Few people — and essentially nobody today — really need a pilot / aviator watch or a diver’s watch. Modern, digital instruments have relegated mechanical watches to a category of.a historical curiosity.

 

But everyone attends formal occasions at least sometimes, and a diver’s watch — regardless of how expensive — will not work for that. 

 

The beauty of a light-powered watch, especially for utility field watches, is that they don’t rely on a power grid or human arms or fingers to keep them powered up. As long as it’s not kept in a dark drawer for years, the watch will keep an accurate track of time.

 

The key words are utility and dependability.

 

Because of its ability to operate without requiring our attention, it would have been nice if the watch also included a perpetual calendar, so it would continue showing the correct date across months and years, — or, more realistically — if the watch did not feature the date window at all. 

 

Since I had this watch, it ran at much greater accuracy than the rated +/- 15 seconds per month. (With less than 1 second of deviation per month.) To further allow the owner to admire this precision, it would also be nice to be able to adjust the hour hand separately for daylight savings and travel without disrupting the seconds and minutes.

 

But such complications (perpetual calendar, independent hour hand) are firmly outside of the field watch category.
