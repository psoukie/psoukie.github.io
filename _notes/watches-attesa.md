This titanium watch with a perpetual calendar, quick time zone switching, and atomic clock reception is the frequent fliers’ perfect companion.

I discovered Attesa by way of searching for a traveler GMT watch with a dressier look. Something that could work well – both in form and function – for a business traveler. The search out to be more difficult than I expected.

First, many GMT watches are “desk” or office GMTs – they are designed to change the GMT hand independently to make it easy to read time in other places without disrupting the primary time shown by the standard hands. That is not ideal for my needs,[^GMT] and besides, a better tool for reading time for multiple locations around the world while sitting at your desk is to buy one of the world time desk clocks.

My favorite world time clock maps the time zones to just one third of the world time dial, allowing the globe to be shown in the familiar Mercator projection.

[^GMT]: I have learned to read the time of locations I deal with on a regular basis on the fly (pun not intended): e.g. Paris is typically 9 hours ahead of Seattle, which is minus 3 hours and the opposite of day / night.

What I was looking for was a convenient ability to change the hour hand rapidly when I am travelling without disrupting the time. This is the real allure of a GMT watch for me. And this allowed me to expand my search beyond what is mostly dive watch designs with GMT hands to (admittedly quite rare) watches that feature a quick set hour hand.[^quick-set-hour]

[^quick-set-hour]: Quick set hour feature allows the hour hand to be independently adjusted without stopping the watch and disrupting the minute hand.

And I stumbled on a complete revelation: Citizen *Attesa CB1120-50G* – a titanium, light-powered watch with a perpetual calendar, worldwide time zones, and wireless reception of atomic clocks. All this in a diminutive, dress-watch-like 38mm case, 9.3mm thin, for under $300.[^market] (Yes, three hundred USD, not three thousand.) For this price, you get all of the above, executed with a Japanese precision: The seconds hand hits every mark precisely without a shudder, and I did not find any defects even under a loupe.

[^market]: Depending on the foreign exchange rate, as Citizen inexplicably does not sell many of their watches (including the high-end _The Citizen_ pieces that are comparable to *Grand Seiko*) outside of domestic market.

# Form and Function

What does a business traveler need in a watch? And does anyone really even need a wrist watch nowadays? As a dedicated, single-purpose tool, a watch should be superior to multipurpose devices such as smartphones and smart watches. Most watches (and this one more than others) definitely are.

Form and function – coupled, perhaps, with meaning – are the main criteria we evaluate watches on. In terms of subjective to objective, they probably rank from meaning to form to function. In terms of importance, these items are both situational and subjective. 

## Function

Starting with function, the Attesa impresses with its ability to run reliably on its own while keeping accurate track of time across time zones and daylight savings adjustments. From the functional perspective, this is an ultimate watch for a traveler:

* It’s powered by light so you never need to worry about forgetting to wind the watch, charging it every night, or having it run out of battery while on a trip.

* It is very accurate. It’s quartz crystal will keep good time (TK precision) even during longer trips outside of the atomic clock radio coverage.

* It seamlessly switches between time zones (including those with 30-minute differences, that would challenge GMT watches) and keeps accurate date across months and years.

* Affordable — no worries about losing or dinging the watch at the airport security check.

* Very subtle, but efficient lume on the hands and hour markers.

* Clean design (city names, DST and reception labels are discreet) 

* And because it’s affordable, you won’t be too distressed if it gets dinged or lost while negotiating security checkpoints after a short night of sleep.

* The radio signal has a low frequency with wave length over three miles, and can therefore travel a long distance with low energy and – unlike GPS signal – can easily pass through walls.

This watch could be left on the Moon, and it would happily keep track of time and calendar for years. In most places on the Northern hemisphere here on Earth, it would do so while adjusting to an atomic clock through a radio signal.



Would you do not get is a world timer or a GMT indication with an explicit am/pm designation. Still, for people unaccustomed to converting between time zones, the crown offers a fast way to “fly” between locations and see the hour hand adjust in real time.

## Form

This Attesa has a very clean, classical dial. At a glance, all you see are the applied roman indices at 12 and 6, the batons indicating the remaining hours (with the exception of 3 which has a small but readable date window), the hands, and the labels *Citizen* and *Attesa*. (the latter is a recent addition which balances the layout).

More subtle are the minute track marks and lume dots, the indicators for atomic clock synchronization status and daylight savings time that are disguised as markers of the minute track, and the airport codes on the inside bezel that let you quickly select between all the world time zones.

Interestingly, previous versions of this watch had the airport codes displayed in a more pronounced way, with large lettering and more contrasting color. This new dial makes the locations inconspicuous — with gray color and smaller size. I will say it is a trade off because in insufficient light, the codes are difficult to read. Obviously, if you know how many time zones you want to change, you can do the operation even in a dim cabin.

Unlike some other light-powered watches , I am unable to detect any pattern or color change which would betray the presence of a photo-voltaic element.

The dial does seem to slope gently to its center, givin it a sense of depth, but it could be an illusion. The flat saphire crystal underscores the dress-like simplicity of the whole package.

Simplicity does not equal austerity though. The metal ring around the sapphire crystal and two of the three facets on the side of the case were given a silver-colored reflective treatment of the Duratec coating. It is a subtle effect but elevates the look from what could otherwise be too much of the moon-surface-looking titanium.

Under loupe, you can further appreciate the finishing on the roman numerals and batons that seem made of the same material but with a brushed or ridged surface.

Finally, in addition to a partially protected regular crown that serves to operate all the key functions of the watch (including changing DST) in one of its two positions, there is also a small pusher and one recessed pusher.

A case could be made for …

The small pusher to be recessed as well — you need it only to check whether the last night time sync was successful, request a manual sync, and to manually set the year, date and time. Operations that, once you had the watch for a few days, you’re unlikely to need — but I understand that if the pusher was recessed, it would be more frustrating.

The recessed button is only needed if the hands ever gotten out of alignment, and I personally never used it.

The watch comes on a titanium bracelet which is replacable but the lug width is very small (TK mm), so it’s probably not practical.

(while, in my eyes, an aviator/pilot watch or a dress watch would fit the bill much better as the basis.)



The watch shares the characteristics of the Promaster Tough: you don’t need to worry about this watch. Left to its own devices, it ill be as accurate in five years as a typical mechanica watch is after five days — but without any need for  charging — and it will show the correct time to boot.

I’ve seen at least one review which missed the presence of the perpetual calendar (which does not depend on the radio controlled settings). To actually show the name of the day and month on the dial is more of a flex than a need.  While I am often unsure about the date, I always know what day of the week it is and which month we are in.

To cram the dial with all the other information is to show off. Why clutter the watch with a leap year counter? It is a more powerful, understated, and aesthetically pleasin choice to only show the date. “But how will people know the watch has that ability?” They won’t and, it is a good test of whether your modesty and restraint can match that embodied by the watch, or if you won’t be able to stop yourself from telling people.

(To anyone objecting that in a quartz watch, including a perpetual calendar is simple, the mechanism to control and adjust the time and date correctly is not trivial, and in a mechanical watch, the perpetual calendar can be achieved with only nine additional parts.

In fact, none of the complications and special features are visibly heralded. No special dial for low power reserve. Month and year? Only shown while setting the time manually. And the airport codes that hint at the ability to adjust the hands (sic) to a different time zone are printed in discrete lettering.

Enclosed in a hardened titatium case and protected by a saphire plass, the watch can also withstand some physical abuse.

With a  twist of a pulled crowned, the watches changes between timezones, including those with a half-hour difference.

I suspect many watch enthusiasts look at their watches for three reasons: to check the time, to simply enjoy their beauty, and to see how the watch is doing and if it needs any attention or adjustment.

This one doesn’t.

Unless you are going to put the watch in a dark drawer, the Attesa does not need your help. And even then, it would continue quietly keeping time for two years.

Thanks to its precision and perpetual calendar, it can do really well even without the atomic clock signal. 

Simply put, this watch doesn’t need you. If you’re not prepared for a strong, light, slim, accurate, and independent watch, you might look for other options.

But if you could use a sharp, light-powered watch that can breeze through time zones and catch atomic clock at the speed of light, you just need to choose the color.
