This titanium watch with a perpetual calendar, quick time zone switching, and an atomic clock receiver is the frequent fliers’ perfect companion.

I discovered Attesa CB1120-50G by way of searching for a traveler GMT watch with a dressier look. Something that could work well – both in form and function – for a business traveler. This search turned out to be more difficult than I expected.

First, many GMT watches are “desk” or office GMTs – they are designed to change the GMT hand independently to make it easy to read time in other places without disrupting the primary time shown by the standard hands. That is not ideal for my needs,[^GMT] and besides, a better tool for reading time for multiple locations around the world while sitting at your desk is to buy one of the world time desk clocks.

My favorite world time clock maps the time zones to just one third of the world time dial, allowing the globe to be shown in the familiar Mercator projection.

[^GMT]: I have learned to read the time of locations I deal with on a regular basis on the fly (pun not intended): e.g. Paris is typically 9 hours ahead of Seattle, which is minus 3 hours and the opposite of day / night.

What I was looking for was a convenient ability to change the hour hand rapidly when I am travelling without disrupting the time. This is the real allure of a GMT watch for me. And this allowed me to expand my search beyond what is mostly dive watch designs with GMT hands to (admittedly quite rare) watches that feature a quick set hour hand.[^quick-set-hour]

[^quick-set-hour]: Quick set hour feature allows the hour hand to be independently adjusted without stopping the watch and disrupting the minute hand.

And I stumbled on a complete revelation: Citizen *Attesa CB1120-50G* – a titanium, light-powered watch with a perpetual calendar, worldwide time zones, and wireless reception of atomic clocks. All this in a slim, dress-watch-sized 38mm case.

# Form and Function

What does a business traveler need in a watch? And does anyone really even need a wrist watch nowadays? As a dedicated, single-purpose tool, a watch should be superior to multipurpose devices such as smartphones and smart watches. Most watches (and this one more than others) definitely are.

Form and function – coupled, perhaps, with meaning – are the main criteria we evaluate watches on. In terms of subjective to objective, they probably rank from meaning to form to function. In terms of importance, these items are both situational and subjective.

## Function

Starting with function, the Attesa impresses with its autonomous reliability and accuracy. From the functional perspective, this is an ultimate watch for a traveler which stands easily above any mechanical or smart watch:

* You never need to worry about forgetting to wind or charge the watch or running out of battery while on a trip. The Attesa is powered by light and has a ridiculous six-month power reserve (with a two-year power save mode).
* It is very accurate. On its own, the H149 movement is certified to ±15 seconds per month, but judging by a similar Citizen it could be much more precise in practice.[^promaster] Regardless, the Attesa is guaranteed to be ten times more accurate than a certified chronometer even on a long trip outside of the atomic clock radio coverage.
* It seamlessly switches between time zones with a pull and twist of the crown, including for India and parts of Australia with their GMT-hand-defying 30-minute differences. And thanks to its perpetual calendar, the date is always correct as it autonomously keeps track of days, months and leap years.

Would you do not get is a world timer or a GMT indication, and there is no explicit am/pm differentiation. For locations you cannot convert easily in your head, the watch offers a fast way to “fly” between locations by using the crown and seeing the hands adjust in real time.

[^promaster]: My Citizen Promaster Tough with the same rating and similar price point has been off by about one second per month.

### Atomic Clock Synchronization

The watch has a receiver that synchronizes it to atomic clocks via radio signals from stations in the United States, Europe, Japan and China. Compared to GPS, the radio signal has a low frequency (with wave length over three miles) which can travel a long distance and pass through walls, as long as you are within coverage.[^coverage]

The transmitted information includes full date and also future date of daylight savings time change. The automated daylight savings changes can be disabled with manual adjustment, and the watch will also remember any individual DST adjustments you made for each time zone.

### Operating the watch

TK With a  twist of a pulled crowned, the watches changes between timezones, including those with a half-hour difference.

To check or change the time zones, you simply pull the crown into the first position, and the seconds hand will quickly point to the city code of the current time zone. You can move between the cities by turning the crown (with discernible clicks). The seconds hand jumps between the selections and the hour hand (and minute hand and date, if needed) adjust in real time.

To check the daylight savings time of the location you are viewing, pull the crown to the second position. The seconds hand will move to indicate whether the DST is on or off, and – if needed – you can manually override the daylight savings for this location by turning the crown.

With the crown pushed in, the watch allows you to quickly check the result of last night’s automated reception by pressing the push button on the side, or force a manual synchronization with a long press.

The time, date and year can be also set manually by using the crown in combination with the push button. Lastly, should there be a problem with the alignment of the hands, there is one more recessed button that allows you to reset the hands.

[^coverage]: I live north west of Seattle which is fairly far from the WWVB Fort Collins station in Denver, CO, but the watch receives the signal successfully almost every night even in a watch case. If live outside of the radio coverage, you can either set the time, date and year manually or use one of several free mobile apps that produce audible signal that the watch is able to pick up and decode.

This watch could be left on the Moon, and it would happily keep track of time and calendar for years. In most places on the Northern hemisphere here on Earth, it would do so while adjusting to an atomic clock through a radio signal.

### Characteristics

TK accurate, light, thin, quick timezone switching (including zones with a 30 minute difference), perpetual calendar, classical diameter, metal bracelet, water proof to 10 ATM, magnetic resistance, shock resistance,

## Form

This Attesa has a very clean, classical dial. Without a closer look, all you see are the applied roman indices at 12 and 6, the hands and applied batons (except for the small but readable date window at&nbsp;3), and the labels *Citizen* and *Attesa* (the latter a recent addition which balances the layout).

![Attesa dial TK]()

The rest is more subtle: The minute hash marks, lume dots, and labels (disguising as hash marks) for synchronization status and daylight savings all share the minute track on the lower, steeper part of the flange (*rehaut*). The city codes are printed at the top of the upper, flatter part flange, above the printed extension of the batons and lumes.

Interestingly, previous versions of this watch did not display the name *Attesa* (which balances the layout nicely), and the city codes were shown in larger lettering and more contrasting color. This new dial makes the time zones inconspicuous. It is a trade off because in insufficient light, the codes are hard to read, but one that errs on the right side. Even for frequent fliers, most time spent with a watch is not by adjusting them, and if you know how many time zones you want to cross, you can make the change even in a dim cabin.

The dial does seem to slope gently to its center, giving it a sense of depth, but it could be an illusion. The flat sapphire crystal underscores the dress-like simplicity of the whole package. Unlike with some other light-powered watches, I am unable to detect any pattern or color change which would betray the presence of a photo-voltaic element.

Simplicity does not equal austerity though. The bezel and two of the three side facets of the case use a silver-colored reflective Duratec coating, contrasting with the moon-surface-like rest of the Duratec treated case. It is a subtle effect that elevates the look.

Under loupe, you can further appreciate the finishing on the roman numerals and batons that seem made of the same material but with a brushed or ridged surface.

* Very subtle, but efficient lume on the hands and hour markers.

* Clean design (city names, DST and reception labels are discreet)

Finally, in addition to a partially protected crown, there is also a small pusher and one recessed pusher.

A case could be made for TK … The small pusher to be recessed as well — you need it only to check whether the last night time sync was successful, request a manual sync, and to manually set the year, date and time. Operations that, once you had the watch for a few days, you’re unlikely to need — but I understand that if the pusher was recessed, it would be more frustrating.

The recessed button is only needed if the hands ever gotten out of alignment, and I personally never used it.

The watch comes on a titanium bracelet which is replaceable but the lug width is very small (TK mm), so it’s probably not practical.

The only negative, after a few months of wearing it, is that the clasp of the bracelet is showing hairline scratches. It clearly did not receive the same Duratec treatment as the case.

TK Enclosed in a hardened titatium case and protected by a saphire plass, the watch can also withstand some physical abuse.

The watch shares the characteristics of the Promaster Tough: you don’t need to worry about this watch. Left to its own devices, it ill be as accurate in five years as a typical mechanica watch is after five days — but without any need for  charging — and it will show the correct time to boot.

I’ve seen at least one review which missed the presence of the perpetual calendar (which does not depend on the radio controlled settings). To actually show the name of the day and month on the dial is more of a flex than a need.  While I am often unsure about the date, I always know what day of the week it is and which month we are in.

To cram the dial with all the other information is to show off. Why clutter the watch with a leap year counter? It is a more powerful, understated, and aesthetically pleasin choice to only show the date. “But how will people know the watch has that ability?” They won’t and, it is a good test of whether your modesty and restraint can match that embodied by the watch, or if you won’t be able to stop yourself from telling people.

(To anyone objecting that in a quartz watch, including a perpetual calendar is simple, the mechanism to control and adjust the time and date correctly is not trivial, and in a mechanical watch, the perpetual calendar can be achieved with only nine additional parts.

In fact, none of the complications and special features are visibly heralded. No special dial for low power reserve. Month and year? Only shown while setting the time manually. And the airport codes that hint at the ability to adjust the hands (sic) to a different time zone are printed in discrete lettering.

## Meaning

Meaning is an important part of our decision process – not just with watches. The story behind the brand, how the product is made, and other aspects that are meaningful to us all affect how we perceive the product.

### The Brand

Subjectively, because I am not familiar with Citizen, the brand is a bit of a low point. If I were to select a GMT watch based on meaning alone, I would go with the Longines Zulu (see in [Alternatives](#alternatives) below). Longines aviation history and design are authentic and compelling, and even ties to the first non-stop transpacific flight which landed not far from where I live.

There were two things I knew before I bought this watch: Citizen movement 0100 was (and I think still is) the only autonomous wrist watch with a precision of ±1 second per year. That is so insanely precise you’d have to start worrying about leap seconds. This also made me aware of their domestic-only “The Citizen” series which seem to be on par (Zaratsu polishing included) with Grand Seiko.

### History

But this watch grew on me as I learned more about it, to a point of me writing this review: something I have not done about any other watch. (Partially because other watches have plenty of reviews online, but still.)

One example is the history of the radio controlled watches which is absolutely fascinating, starting with this prediction from 1898:

> There is something very beautiful in this action of the “Marconi” wave. In a city supplied with this apparatus we should be conscious as we hear each hour strike that above us and around us, swiftly and silently, this electrical wave is passing, conscientiously doing its work, and setting each clock in each establishment absolutely right, without any physical connection whatsoever between the central distributing clock, and those which it keeps correct by means of this mysterious electrical wave.
>
> We might go even still further, … and have our watches  automatically set by this electrical wave as we walk about the streets.[^source]

It took almost one hundred years until the technology fully caught up to this dream. (With Junghans MEGA&nbsp;1 being the first ever such wrist watch.) By this time though, the clocks were not being synchronized to just any central clock but to atomic clocks. When the proposed US budget in 2018 aimed to cut funds for the radio stations that make this technology possible, they survived because too many clocks depended on it. Just like about a hundred years prior, the radio time signals helped save the Eiffel Tower from demolition.

### Innovation

The other thing that makes this watch meaningful to me is its embrace of innovation over antiquity. Even though I admire the beauty of old things (I have a working typewriter which is more than a hundred years old and most of my watches are – let’s be objective – quaint mechanical contraptions), I also like when people use innovation for elegant new solutions.

I am more mesmerized by the insane efficiency of Attesa’s light-powered movement than by the straightforward action of a rotor in a self-winding watch. My brain – conditioned to equate ‘heavy’ with solid – is gently reminded of its fallibility when I put on the much lighter but stronger titanium watch.

Lastly, even though this watch is objectively better at its job than any other I have seen, the watch is an exercise in modesty and restraint.

## Cost

At the time of writing, a new CB1120-50G can be purchased for under $300.[^market] (Yes, three hundred USD, not three thousand.) That’s an significant value for the price. And the watch holds even under a closer examination: I did not notice any visible imperfections (even under a loupe) and the dead beat seconds hand hits every hashmark precisely, without a shudder.

[^market]: Depending on the foreign exchange rate, as Citizen inexplicably does not sell many of their watches (including the high-end _The Citizen_ pieces that are comparable to *Grand Seiko*) outside of domestic market.

The affordability of the Attesa compared to its alternatives is relevant: Dings and mishaps happen, especially when navigating airports and plane cabins after a short night of sleep. Instead of needing you to baby it, this stylish, resilient watch has your back. When you put it on, you can focus on your day.

# Conclusion

I suspect many watch enthusiasts look at their watches for three reasons: to check the time, to enjoy their beauty, and to check how well the watch is doing in case it needs winding or adjustment.

This one doesn’t.

Unless you are going to put it in a cave for two years, the Attesa will do just fine. Thanks to its perpetual calendar and precise quartz movement, it does well even away from the radio signals.

It is light, slim and strong and also accurate and independent to a point of “do not even bother checking.” 

It might not be for everyone but if you could use a light-powered titanium watch that can breeze through time zones and synchronize with atomic clocks at the speed of light without showing off, you just need to choose the dial color.
