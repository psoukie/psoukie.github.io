# Attesa
The watch shares the characteristics of the Promaster Tough: you don’t need to worry about this watch. Left to its own devices, it ill be as accurate in five years as a typical mechanica watch is after five days — but without any need for  charging — and it will show the correct time to boot.
I’ve seen at least one review which missed the presence of the perpetual calendar (which does not depend on the radio controlled settings). To actually show the name of the day and month on the dial is more of a flex than a need.  While I am often unsure about the date, I always know what day of the week it is and which month we are in.
To cram the dial with all the other information is to show off. Why clutter the watch with a leap year counter? It is a more powerful, understated, and aesthetically pleasin choice to only show the date. “But how will people know the watch has that ability?” They won’t and, it is a good test of whether your modesty and restraint can match that embodied by the watch, or if you won’t be able to stop yourself from telling people.
(To anyone objecting that in a quartz watch, including a perpetual calendar is simple, the mechanism to control and adjust the time and date correctly is not trivial, and in a mechanical watch, the perpetual calendar can be achieved with only nine additional parts.

In fact, none of the complications and special features are visibly heralded. No special dial for low power reserve. Month and year? Only shown while setting the time manually. And the airport codes that hint at the ability to adjust the hands (sic) to a different time zone are printed in discrete lettering.
I found this watch by way of searching for a traveler GMT watch with a look approximating a dress watch. Something that could be an ideal watch for a business traveler. This turned out to be much harder than I assumed. Many of the GMT watches are “desk” GMTs — they are designed to change the GMT hand independently to make it easy to check what time it is in another place without disrupting the primary time. That is not ideal for my needs: First, I have learned to read the time of locations I deal with on a regular basis on the fly. (Pun not intended. But it works like this: e.g. Paris is “minus” 3 hours from Seattle, and the opposite of day / night, etc.) Second, a better tool for reading time for multiple locations around the world at once while sitting at your desk is to buy one of the world time desk clocks. My favorite model maps the world to just one third of the world time dial, allowing the familiar Mercator TK projection.

What I did not have and what would have been very convenient is to change the hour hand rapidly whenever I am travelling without disrupting the time. This is the real allure of a GMT watch for me. But, this need can be addressed by any watch that features a quick set hour adjustment. And this allowed me to expand my search beyond what is mostly dive watches-derived designs with GMT hands, while, in my eyes, an aviator/pilot watch or a dress watch would fit the bill much better as the basis.
TK mention Longines Zulu, and the VHF Longines
— —

accurate, light, thin, quick timezone switching (including zones with a 30 minute difference), perpetual calendar, classical diameter, metal bracelet, water proof to 10 ATM, magnetic resistance, shock resistance,
solar powered (no worrying about batteries running out or forgetting to wind the watch)
Great accuracy even without radio sync.
Dead beat second without a bounce, perfectly aligned with the indeces 
Affordable — no worries about losing or dinging the watch at the airport security check.
Very subtle, but efficient lume on the hands and hour markers.
Clean design (city names, DST and reception labels are discreet)

Alternatives:
* SBGP003 - bigger, more accurate, different class and price, but could just as well go with The Citizen (no atomic radio or timezone switching, but same Zaratsu polishing, much higher accuracy and independently set hour hand)
* Longines VHP — not really a contender
* Longines Zulu — automatic, so very different. Would be perfect in 40mm or less.
* Rolex GMT Master II — I would prefer the Longines for its authentic connection in history and design to flying.
* Seiko 5 GMT
* Higher-end Citizens — Exceed (identical, but likely better finishing)

Starting with function, the Attes impresses with its ability to run on its own. You could leave thi swatch on the Moon, and  it would happily keep track of time and dates. And in most places on the Earth, it would do so while synchronized with an atomic clock through a radio signal.
Enclosed in a hardened titatium case and protected by a saphire plass, the watch can also withstand some physical abuse.
With a  twist of a pulled crowned, the watches changes between timezones, including those with a half-hour difference.
I suspect many watch enthusiasts look at their watches for three reasons: to check the time, to simply enjoy their beauty, and to see how the watch is doing and if it needs any attention or adjustment.
This one doesn’t.
Unless you are going to put the watch in a dark drawer, the Attesa does not need your help. And even then, it would continue quietly keeping time for two years.
Thanks to its precision and perpetual calendar, it can do really well even without the atomic clock signal. 
Simply put, this watch doesn’t need you. If you’re not prepared for a strong, light, slim, accurate, and independent watch, you might look for other options.
But if you could use a sharp, light-powered watch that can breeze through time zones and catch atomic clock at the speed of light, you just need to choose the color.

What does a business traveler need in a watch? And do you really even need one?
As a dedicated, single-purpose tool, a watch is in many ways superior to multipurpose devices such as smartphones.
While looking for a wtach with a traveler GMT function or an independently adjustable hour hand, I stumbled on a complete revelation: a titatniu, light-powered watch with a perpetual calendar, worldwide time zones, wireless sync to atomic clocks, precisely aligned seconds hand without a shudder. And all this in a diminutive, dress-watch-like 38mm case, 9.3mm thin, and priced at $300.
FORM AND FUNCTION - these two are the main criteria, coupled, perhaps, with meaning — thata we can assign to and evaluate watches on. In terms of objectivity, they probably rank, in ascending order, from meaning to form to function.
FUNCTION: From the functional perspective, this is an ultimate woatch for a traveler — never worry about forgetting to wind or replace battery - always accurate - even during longer trips outside of the radio coverage — and can do the 30-minute changes that a GMT cannot.
Would you do not get is a world-timer or a GMT indication with an explicit am/pm designation. For people not accustumed to converting between time zones, the crown offers a fast way to “fly” between locations and see the hour hand adjust in real time.
FORM: This Attesa has a very clean, classical dial. At a glance, all you see are the applied batons and roman indeces at 12 and 6, the hands and a smalll but readable date window, and the labels Citizen and Attesa (which is also a recent addition which balances the layout).
More subtle are the minute track marks and lume dots, the indicatos for radio signal reception status, and daylight savings time that are disguised as markers of the minute track, and the airport codes on the inside bezel that let you quickly select between all the world timezones.
Interestingly, previous versions of this watch had the airport codes displayed in a more pronounced way, with large lettering and more contrasting color. This new dial makes the locations inconspicuous — with gray color and smaller size. I will say it is a trade off because in insufficient light, the codes are difficult to read. Obviously, if you know how many time zones you want to change, you can do the operation even in a dim cabin.
Unlike some other light-powered watches , I am unable to detect any pattern or color change which would betray the presence of a photo-voltaic element.
The dial does seem to slope gently to its center, givin it a sense of depth, but it could be an illusion. The flat saphire crystal underscores the dress-like simplicity of the whole package.
Simplicity does not equal austerity though. The metal ring around the sapphire crystal and two of the three facets on the side of the case were given a silver-colored reflective treatment of the Duratec coating. It is a subtle effect but elevates the look from what could otherwise be too much of the moon-surface-looking titanium.
Under loupe, you ca further appreciate the finishing on the roman numerals and bators that see made of the same material but with a brushed or ridged surface.
Finally, in addition to a partially protected regular crown that serves to operate all the key functions of the watch (including changing DST) in one of its two positions, there is also a small pusher and one recessed pusher.
A case could be made for …
The small pusher to be recessed as well — you need it only to check whether the last night time sync was successful, request a manual sync, and to manually set the year, date and time. Operations that, once you had the watch for a few days, you’re unlikely to need — but I understand that if the pusher was recessed, it would be more frustrating.
The recessed button is only needed if the hands ever gotten out of alignment, and I personally never used it.
The watch comes on a titanium bracelet which is replacable but the lug width is very small (TK mm), so it’s probably not practical.
