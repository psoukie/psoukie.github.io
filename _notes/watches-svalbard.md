# Svalbard

The meditation about time with a one-hand 24-hour Svalbard watch
#watches
Life is short, slow down.
A one-hand, 24-hour watch is a more fitting and accurate portrayal of the passing of time. A single hand completes a full circle in 24 hours.
TK Footnote/factbox about the equation of time
Wearing the Svalbard with its one hand and 24-hour dial feels very different from wearing any other kind of a watch. There is no oppresion from the minute hand, no constant pressure of the manically  advancing seconds. Yet, its ten-minute markers between the hours make this still a very functional watch for almost all purposes.
The single hand of the Svalbard moves at half the speed of a standard hour hand, freeing you from the oppression teh steady creep of the minute hand; a complete opposite of the manical second hand.
Whenever I look at the 24-hour dial, I’m seeing a day at a glance. One revolution of the Earth, of course. But in that dial, you can visualize all the segments of the full day. Work, sleep, and all the activities of your one full day of life can be mentally projected on its dial.
A single hand pointing at the exact one moment of the day which is now. Of course, there is a reason for 12-hour dials which are easier to read because of having to accommodate only one half of the day (and the markers) on their faces, and for digital indication of time which can have even more space available to display the precise time with greater clarity.
Whether it’s directly displayed numerical time, 12-hour dial with two or three hands, a 24-hour dial,  they all feature a level of abstraction, and unconscious decoding as we read the time. But there is something deeply meaningful in watching the hand move one rotation just as the sun moves in the sky.
Our lives and life times seem more fittingly measured with the movement of celestial bodies — the rotation of the Earth we inhabit around its axis and annual revolutions around the Sun — than with a rocket launch countdown of the seconds.
To understand how deliberate it is in its movement, it only circles the dial — of course — 365 times a year.
TK — from later draft
To get in touch with this natural flow, there is no better watch than one with a 24-hour dial and a single hand.

Its only hand matches the speeed with which the Sun moves in hte sky.e This lends the watch a completely different feel. To illustrate this, the speed is half slower than a regular hour hand, freeing you — once you get used to it….
Once you get used to reading the time, you’ll find it gives you enough precision for almont everything you need. You won’t be using it to measure two minutes for searing a steak, but it will get you through a day of meetings without problems.
That being said, even though you can read the time to an accuracy of around 2 minutes easily, it is not how I would use this watch. For me, the charm comes from being freed from the incessant crawl of the minute hand and the racing of the manic second hand.
A day with a 24-hour one-hand watch is akin to visiting a retreat. It gives you a break from the unnecesary information overload of to-the-second precision, and connects you with th nature by means of turning your mind to how people started to measure the time in the first place — by observing the movement of the Sun and the Moon and the stars.
A small detour — solar noon; equation of time; daylight savings — why permanent DST is a bad idea — people can change the schedule of events — if regular, accustomed time is too early or late in parts of the season — but why mess even further with what “noon” is?

It is a meditative experience which might ironically make you think of time as a more precious commodity than a regular watch. The hand makes only one revolution per day — only 365 per year — and yet, you can see it move, just like you can see the Sun move. How many revolutions do you have lseft to accomplish the important things you care about this year? And in your life? The number is not very large.
