# Christopher Ward

#watches
“Mementos”
The C? TK Slimline has a deserved spot in my collection as a beautiful reminder of tree distinct things.
First, the very first watch I ever bought with any real intention about what I’m buying after a careful consideration was a Christoper Ward CX TK Malvern. It was, and still is, an example of a beautifully crasfter watch at a price point significantly lower than comparable watches by other brands.
But it is also a reminder of how quickly things change in the world and in business. Back then, Christopher Ward was making a large selection of watches — dress watches, and also women watches — and also inspired limited editions that were distinguished not just by a number, but by actually embedding a cut out piece of metal — a fragment of a famous race car or a plane — that made history. While today, these options are nowhere to be seen.
Lastly, but most importantly, this watch was gifted to me by my wife and bears a dedication inscribed around its case back.
The watch would hold its place on its own though. It is the thinnest watch at TK mm (TK check against Svalbard and Attesa), even thinner than my two quartz watches. It is the only one with a dial with only the hour batons, without minute marks. These characteristicts, together with leaving the dial without a date window, make this a perfect dress watch. (Ignoring the blue dial, which some might feel is not in strict keeping with a dress watch.) To make it even classier, you could argue that the second hand could be removed, to make it even more serene. But that’s a matter of taste.
The combination of a simple manually wound movement, thin profile, clean dial, and TK ….
This watch has also confirmed to me how much the strap or band can elevate the watch. After several years when my original blue leather strap with alligator texture had worn off, I bought a new Christopher Ward cordovan leather strap of deeper color, and swapped its butterfly clasp with the new logo for the previous one to match the watch. The smooth deep blue of this new strap has completely transformed this watch. This experience made me pay more attention to the effect and difference the staps make in making your watch look ordinary or turning it into a star.
