Imagine a moment from your favorite adventure movie or drama. Imagine you are the hero. And imagine what happens next is up to you. "Text adventures" (or interactive fiction) are a modern text-based medium that opens up worlds of possibilities not limited by CGI effects or a single story-line but only by your imagination. Let me briefly touch on its fascinating history that includes cave explorations, early virtual computers and the rise of graphic adventures, to finally emerge in its state-of-the-art with the spread of the Internet.

The story starts with Will Crowther, one of the three software developers of ARPANET (the forerunner of Internet), who managed to overshadow this achievement by writing _Colossal Cave Adventure_ game (or simply _Adventure_). The game was based on a kind of a dialog: The player types in a simple command (such as TAKE KEY), and the program narrates back the results. It simulated the exploration of the environment (based on Crowther's mapping of parts of Mammoth Caves in Kentucky) enriched by some puzzles and fantasy elements. More details are given by Dennis G. Jerz in [“Somewhere Nearby is Collosal Cave”](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009.html "Link to the full article") .[^details]

[^details]: The article – running at over 17,000 words – includes images of the actual cave and an analysis of the original source code. It was published on the 30th anniversary of _Adventure_.

Crowther's game (originally written to amuse his daughters) gained a following and inspired others. Among these were some  MIT students who founded **Infocom** in 1979. To make their first game, *Zork*, playable outside of university mainframes, they designed a specialized virtual computer called the Z-machine. This was quickly implemented for TRS-80 and Apple II microcomputers with more to follow – 16&nbsp;years before Java Virtual Machine. Infocom went on to produce several critically acclaimed titles such as *Trinity*, a symbolical and surreal work dealing with the atomic bomb, or a sci-fi exploring the consequences of a radical political program in *A&nbsp;Mind Forever Voyaging*.

In the eighties, text adventures were top-selling computer games, and they started to evolve into graphical adventure games. Images representing the described locations were added, then the protagonist and his or her movement were also transferred into the picture; lists of verbs (actions) were made available, then reduced, to be ultimately replaced with icons, while objects in the environment were also incorporated into the graphics and made click-able. At the end of this process in the late nineties, there often remained a single generic USE action requiring only a mouse click, and the text vanished.

Although this eliminated some of the problems inherent in the seemingly boundless interface of natural language, many things were lost in the transformation. Instead of guessing the recognized (‘implemented') verbs, nouns and syntax, the player could simply choose from a limited number of actions and apply these to active onscreen objects (hot-spots). But this sacrifices a lot of the variety[^variety] and – by driving the production costs up (in terms of animations or voice-over) – often indirectly reduced the quantity of the content (in terms of plot branching, multiple endings and available options).

[^variety]: In a graphical adventure, “using” a key on a chest has a single interpretation, while the text-based interactive fiction can distinguish between PUT THE KEY IN THE CHEST, LOCK THE CHEST WITH THE KEY, or HIDE THE KEY UNDER THE CHEST.

Commercial interactive fiction practically disappeared by 1989 with the demise of **Infocom**. In retrospect, it might have been good for the new medium. Let’s see why. 

Amateur programmers were trying their hands at producing text adventures of their own already during the commercial era. Writing a game from scratch in a general-purpose programming language is a daunting task though, with most of the effort spent on the 'backbones.' Soon, specialized authoring systems started to appear, and the online services (and later Internet) allowed enthusiasts to connect with each other.

[^twisty]: "This is a thoroughly researched history of interactive fiction, as well as a brilliant analysis of the genre," wrote Steve Meretzky about the book.

[^i7]: Released by Graham Nelson as a beta version, it is a revolutionary departure combining a pseudo-natural programming language with a rule-based approach.

[^t3]: Michael J. Roberts rewrote the system and introduced a complex conversation framework and the ability to modify parsing of the player's commands.

[^ifdb]: The _Interactive Fiction Database_ was created by Michael J. Roberts; it is an interactive fiction equivalent of IMDb.

The difference was that soon the fans had to cater for themselves, and they mostly did so for free. This allowed the authors of the modern works to experiment with the characteristics of the medium. What makes it different from novels or movies? What are the unique strengths or weaknesses? The emphasis was shifted away from solving puzzles (which was the pinnacle of the era when games were written by the programmers for the programmers) to the narrative and emotional impact.

A critical discussion of interactive fiction (and its development as the new media and art form) required some terminology and framework. Drawing parallels with novels and movies is [def]insufficient[note]The medium is inherently interactive and non-linear. It has aspects of a simulation and a game, and features different 'voices' and identities (the protagonist, controlled by the player, usually has his own character, and sometimes even goals).[/note], so the community gradually invented bits and pieces of the theory of interactive fiction. To create a memorable experience, the author needs not only good writing skills but also game design and programming abilities. Interactive fiction also requires more writing than a comparable ‘static' piece.

But when the media characteristics meet the right talent, the result is a tight, polished and interesting story. Some of the free modern works are at least on par with the best Infocom adventures, so no wonder that the current community cherishes those who [def]stand out[note]To name but two: <strong>Andrew Plotkin</strong> for his masterful explorations of the possibilities of the new medium, and <strong>Emily Short</strong> whose work on conversation systems and "simulationist" approach advanced the state-of-the-art.[/note]. Against all odds, the 'text adventures' continue to be published long after the fall of the commercial era, they have become the subject of academic studies, and they seem to be getting even better.

The best way to learn more is to try one of these stories out. A&nbsp;good place to start is <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/" title="Interactive Fiction Database">IFDb</a>. Most of the works can be played on almost any device, including phones. Here are some handy <a href="http://soukie.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/introductiontoif.pdf" title="Instruction PDF by Emily Short">playing instructions</a>. And if you'd like to continue the story of interactive fiction by writing one yourself, I would recommend either <a href="http://www.tads.org/tads3.htm"><em>[caps]tads[/caps]&nbsp;3</em></a> (If you have a solid object-oriented programming background, <em>[caps]tads[/caps] 3</em> is arguably the most robust system available.) or <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/"><em>Inform&nbsp;7</em></a>. Writing in <em>Inform&nbsp;7</em> uses sentences such as "Hercule Poirot is wearing a bowler hat." It is surprisingly efficient in dealing with complex concepts: "If Poirot suspects someone who is incriminated by something carried by the player…" -- which would actually be the source code.]]></content:encoded>
