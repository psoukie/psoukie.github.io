# Hamilton Chronograph H


“Life is short, enjoy it!”
fun … exciting … substantial
My Hamilton Chronograph is a reminder that reason often takes back seat to emotions. And sometimes — as much as our brains are good at rationalizing our choices — sometimes we can’t even explain why we like something.
I have seven watches in my collection, and when I’m deciding which one to wear, my choice skews heavily to the Hamilton. Maybe you have experienced a smilir attraction, whether it’s a watch or something else, where you would find it difficult to articulate the things that draw you to it.
You don’t need to see the movement of this watch through a display case back — which has been historically correctly omitted here — to know your’re wearing a metal engine built for measuring time to an eight of a second.
Just wind up the crown — which requires quite a bit more torque than any other watch I had — and the stop watch second hand and minute subdial are ready to be unleashed with a press of a pusher.
Downsides
The domed (? TK) sapphire glass has an anti-reflective treatment which cancels everything nicely when looking at the dial directly, but you do get some reflections at an angle.
The biggest concern might be the thickness. The watch would still look substantial even at a millimeter or two (or three) less. The design disguises the real dimensions quite well. Luckily, part of the excess height is in the crystal but even then, if you look at the watch outside of your wrist, it is rather bulky.
On the other hand, for a mechanical chronograph, there are not many affordable (or even expensive) alternatives. The case height is basically identical to what you get with a modern Tag Heuer Carrera.
