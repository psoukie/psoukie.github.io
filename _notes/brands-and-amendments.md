>> This article was originally written in October 2018. Prompted by the current news around Kanye West, I am republishing it with small updates. It might be a good segue into a new article about an even bigger problem which was, back then, only emerging: content moderation on online platforms in relation to public figures and political regulations.

Whether their products are apparel, electronics or software, corporations have to think about their brand image and the values they represent and promote. That's because buyers are increasingly conscious of what their choices say about them and they are 'voting with their wallet' to advance the causes they care about.

Corporations aren't people (more on this later), but their actions project values, and unless there is little or no choice, people will react to them. Even dominant companies should ​think ​about ​the ​sentiments ​they ​engender and how many of their users might feel reluctant or resentful. When there are two or more options on the market, the brand's image becomes critical, especially if there are few other differentiators.

These things touch on our voice, power, and freedom.

# Brands and Politics

A brand can get mixed in with politics in several ways: An obvious one is if the company directly lobbies for certain policies. Another is when it chooses to voice their values -- as in **Nike**'s _Believe in Something_ campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick. But it can also get thrown into politics by actions or comments from their brand ambassadors, as was repeatedly the case with **Adidas** and Kanye West in 2018 and again four years later.

## Nike

Much was written about Nike and their Kaepernick campaign. Let's quickly repeat the key points: Colin Kaepernick was the most prominent athlete calling attention to mistreatment of African-Americans by taking the knee during the national anthem. While some people felt this was not a suitable form of protest, it was, of course, perfectly legal.

>> ## Anthem and the First Amendment
>>
>> In a landmark ‘West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette’ decision in 1943, the United States Supreme Court, with a 6-3 vote, overturned an earlier precedent set by the Court in 1940, and ruled that Jehovah’s Witnesses had a right to not salute the American flag and say the Pledge of Allegiance.

Kaepernick's right to take the knee stems from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as upheld by the Supreme Court. Even so, it seems Kaepernick's peaceful protests were a factor in how he was treated by NFL teams.

Nike running the ad with the slogan _"Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything"_ was considered controversial. There is no doubt that Nike lost some customers who felt strongly that Kaepernick's behavior was inappropriate. On the other hand, the company took a firm stand on the side of defending the freedom of expression, and it seems it turned out to be a profitable business decision overall as well.

## Adidas

While Adidas did not chose to run a politically charged commercial, they were repeatedly thrown into controversies regardless because of the remarks from their collaborator Kanye West.

In 2018, he made several charged statements about slavery. On TMZ Live in May, Kanye said: "When you hear about slavery for four hundred years ... that sounds like a choice." And just as Adidas was promoting new shoes under Kanye West's Yeezy brand, he tweeted that "We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th amendment."

>> ## Amendment XIII
>>
>> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

What West might have been trying to say in the tweet was that the 13^th^ Amendment should be changed, and not abolished, but that is not what he wrote. Adidas had nothing to say about this, and I suspect largely because as a German corporation, they lacked a cultural context for, and understanding of, how insensitive and divisive these statements were.

The decision to keep their ties might cause new and bigger problems now. In an October 8, 2022 tweet (which Twitter promptly took down for violating the platform's policies), Kanye attacked the Jewish community. The same day, he released a video on YouTube where he is seen showing porn to shocked Adidas executives during a meeting.

## Cultural Differences

>> ## Freedom of Speech, with Exceptions
>>
>> Similar to many European countries, German law contains prohibitions that take precedence over the freedom of speech. These include incitement to hatred (§130) and dissemination of propaganda material and use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations (§86 and §86a). This is in contrast to the United States where the same acts are protected under the First Amendment.

The two recent incidents were so blatant that they do not merit detailed discussion. What I find interesting is that Adidas executives in Europe might have failed to act four years ago because they culturally and politically misunderstood how controversial the behavior was.

Slavery is an extremely sensitive topic, and a call (clumsy or not) to abolish the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution is at least as problematic as a call to abolish bans on Nazi symbols and propaganda from German's penal code would be.

West's statement that four hundred years of slavery seems like a result of a mental choice made by the slaves would be roughly equivalent to stating that pogroms or holocaust were a result of a choice the Jews made. How would have Adidas respond to that? This is not an exaggeration but a reflection of grasping the cultural differences between United States and Europe. Sadly, the 2022 statements and actions are only too cross-cultural.

# What Can One Do

The view in American society and law is that free speech, even one promoting claims that historically proved to cause terrible harm, should be protected by law. This does not mean (at least has not meant) that newspapers, TV or online platforms are obliged to allow and carry all protected speech.

Nike would be wrong and disrespectful if they pushed this worldview in Germany by advocating abolishing laws against hate speech and symbols of Nazism.

By the same token, Adidas needs to try harder to relate to how insensitive and damaging West's comments are in general, and to understand how they impact their brand and their customers in the United States.

## Consequences and Personal Decisions

Damage to reputation can be serious, and its effects can last a long time, especially with people who want to reward good behavior while sending a signal that unethical will not pay off.

A few examples from my own consumer life:

- During the Kaepernick NFL scandal, I bought and wore a pair of Nike's specifically to reward their position on the issue.
- During **Uber**’s unending public image nose-dive,[^uber] I switched to **Lyft** to avoid feeling bad by association. (I do use Uber in countries where Lyft doesn't operate, which illustrates the point about competition.) Even though they have had a new CEO since 2017, my behavior hasn't switched back.
- While the coordinated exhaust emission deception at **Volkswagen Group** in 2015 might have been forgotten or forgiven by many, I am steady with my commitment not to buy their cars as a

To give a positive example, when **HBO** released a _Last Week Tonight_ episode highly critical of the freedoms in China, they sent a strong signal they would rather forgo their business prospects there than cozy up to their government.

## For Democracy in the U.S.

Regardless of your political views, the reality is that U.S. voters have never been represented equally:

- 16.2% of the U.S. population decides 50 out of 100 voting seats in the Senate.
- In presidential elections, a vote in Wyoming has a 3.7 times more weight than one in California.
- The Supreme Court is, in turn, decided by the President and the Senate.
- The Court's (non-)rulings on Gerrymandering and unlimited political spending push the imbalance further.

If you are reading this and you are an American, it's highly likely you are one of the more than 80% people underrepresented by this system. Even though it's diminished, your vote is still important. And ironically, since corporations are now considered people,[^united] you have an opening to wrestle some of your power back. The companies ultimately depend on someone doing business with them, and you have an opportunity to let them know what you think.

[^competition]: If you disagree with the ethical choices of companies that have a (near) monopoly, you might be forced to use their products or services anyway. But even then, such companies should think carefully about the sentiments they engender.

[^uber]: These ranged from systematically targeting the competitor, Lyft, in 2014 by booking thousands of fake rides, through deceiving law-enforcement in 2017, spying on its customers, and sexual harassment scandals.

[^united]: The Court voted 5-4 in the case 'Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission' in 2010 that the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for communications by corporations.
